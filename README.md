# CSS Visual Learner

CSS Visual Learner is an interactive learning tool designed to help both beginners and advanced users understand the impact of various CSS properties in real-time. This tool provides a hands-on approach for experimenting with CSS, making it easier to see how changes in CSS affect web layouts and designs.

## Features

- **Live CSS Rule Application:** Instantly see how different CSS rules change the appearance of elements.
- **Interactive Visualizers:** Explore various CSS properties like Flexbox, Grid, and the Box Model through interactive examples.
- **Responsive Design:** A mobile-friendly interface that adapts to different screen sizes for a seamless learning experience on any device.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** See immediate changes and effects as you interact with the visualizers.
- **Extendable Platform:** Easily add more visualizers or modify existing ones thanks to a modular and scalable code structure.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
- Basic understanding of HTML and CSS.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fahdi/css-visual-learner.git
cd css-visual-learner
```

**For Local Development:**
Open `src/index.html` in your browser to start using the tool.

**For Server Deployment:**
Use the provided Caddyfile configurations for proper routing and redirects.

## How to Use

1. Explore different CSS properties using the interactive visualizers.
2. Use the responsive sidebar for easy navigation between different CSS concepts.
3. Modify the CSS rules directly or use the controls provided in the visualizers to see the changes applied in real-time.

## Server Deployment

This project includes two Caddyfile configurations for different deployment scenarios:

### Standalone Deployment (`Caddyfile`)
For deploying as a standalone site:
- Handles redirects from old URLs to new structure
- Serves files directly from the project directory
- Includes performance optimizations and security headers

### Subfolder Deployment (`Caddyfile.subfolder`)
For deploying as a subfolder on an existing site (e.g., `fahdmurtaza.com/css-visual-learner/`):
- Template configuration for integration into your main Caddyfile
- Handles path-based routing with `handle_path`
- Maintains proper redirects for backward compatibility

## Project Structure

All source code is organized in the `src/` directory:
- `src/index.html` - Main entry point
- `src/visualizers/` - Interactive CSS learning modules
- `src/scripts/` - JavaScript functionality
- `src/styles/` - CSS stylesheets
- `src/assets/` - Images and media files
